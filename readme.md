## About the project

I created this project to play around with Maps. The reason is there are alot of use cases where you need to have maps on your websit. For example let's say you have an fitness app you want to log the area where you go for jog and all. So i just wanted to learn that how can i work with Maps in my web app.

### Things I learnt in this project

1. Working with maps
2. How to navigate through the official documentations.
